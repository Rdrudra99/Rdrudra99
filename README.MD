      Hi, I'm Rudra Narayan Boitei, a Software Developer Executive with a
            focus on web development, specializing in Next.js and MongoDB.
            Currently employed at Typof Technologies, I excel in crafting
            innovative solutions for web applications and websites. Notable
            achievements include spearheading the development of an AI
            E-commerce Website Builder and creating LinkTyp, a platform for
            centralized link management. My skills include proficiency in
            Next.js, React, JavaScript, MongoDB, Git, and GitHub, among others.
            I am passionate about open-source software and have actively
            contributed to various projects. In addition, I have certification
            in Data Structures and Algorithms from GeeksforGeeks. Outside of
            work, I engage in extracurricular activities such as creating
            educational content on YouTube to share knowledge and skills with a
            wider audience.
