# 👋 Hello everyone!

Hi, I'm **@Rdrudra99** 💜 – a Software Engineer on the journey of becoming an Entrepreneur & Indie Maker.

## 🚀 About Me
I’m passionate about building products and sharing insights on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdrudra99/). In late 2024, I made the decision to focus on building and scaling my own SaaS product and providing software services through my brand **Whyme.tech**.

With over 2 years of experience as a **Next.js** developer, I’ve worked on some innovative projects, including **Linktype** – a platform that allows users to create custom websites, and an **AI content generator**. These projects allowed me to learn and grow in full-stack development, as well as honing my product-building skills.

## 🧑‍💻 My Tech Journey
- **Current focus**: Building and scaling my own SaaS product 🚀
- **Tech stack**: JavaScript (Next.js), React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more.
- **Previous experience**: 2+ years as a Next.js developer.
- **Education**: Master of Computer Applications (MCA)
- **Side hustle**: Running **Whyme.tech**, providing software development services.

## 📺 Content & Community
In addition to building products, I share my experiences, tech insights, and entrepreneurial journey with my community on **LinkedIn**. You can follow my updates, tutorials, and advice on technology and entrepreneurship there!

I also used to run a **YouTube channel**, where I shared tech tutorials, coding tips, and more.

## 📈 Let's Connect
I’m always open to collaborating on interesting projects or sharing knowledge. Feel free to reach out to me for:
