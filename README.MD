1. Blueprint (DaVinci Resolve Tutorial Style)
A highly detailed, Pixar-style 3D cartoon character ‚Äî young male with wavy brown hair, bright expressive eyes, wearing a light gray t-shirt and blue hoodie ‚Äî holding an unfolded glowing blueprint with both hands, eyes wide in amazement, mouth slightly open in joy. The blueprint is glowing neon blue with white technical drawings. Background is a dark-to-light vertical blue gradient with a blueprint-style grid overlay. Above the character‚Äôs head, centered and in the upper third, is the word ‚ÄúBLUEPRINT‚Äù in bold 3D block letters ‚Äî white fill, thick blue outline, realistic depth, subtle bevel, and a strong drop shadow. The lighting is cinematic: cool fill light from front, soft rim light on hair and shoulders, slight bloom around blueprint glow. Add a realistic DaVinci Resolve logo (rounded square icon with color wheel) in the bottom-left corner. Ultra-clean composition, high-gloss texture, crisp edge rendering, visually dynamic and friendly. Perfectly centered layout, aspect ratio 16:9.

2. Pro (Futuristic Creator Style)
A sharp, hyper-polished 3D cartoon humanoid robot male ‚Äî medium-dark skin, chiseled face, thick eyebrows, trimmed beard, buzz cut hairstyle. Wears an orange prison-style tech jumpsuit with the badge number ‚ÄúIJC1332‚Äù on the chest. Exposed chrome mechanical neck cables visible from collar. Calm, confident expression, standing slightly right of center. The background is a bright blue radial gradient, clean and futuristic. In the top-left quadrant, large stylized 3D text reads ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù ‚Äî all-caps, white with thick cyan-blue shadows, bevel depth and layered lighting. Below the word ‚ÄúPRO,‚Äù place a large, shiny 3D orange arrow pointing to the right (towards the character). Use soft studio key lighting with a warm kicker light on one side, clean subsurface scattering on face. Balanced composition with strong focus on the character. Clean lines, bold contrast, high-detail textures, cinematic rim light, aspect ratio 16:9.

3. Captions (Fun Social Media Growth Style)
A super expressive 3D cartoon baby monkey character with large round glossy eyes, short brown fur, big pink ears, and a wide-open excited mouth ‚Äî holding a black iPhone-style smartphone with both hands, looking at the screen with shock and joy. Positioned slightly left of center. On the top-right of the composition, the word ‚ÄúCAPTIONS‚Äù appears in bold 3D white bubble letters with thick aqua-blue shadows, aligned top-center and curved slightly. Floating above the monkey‚Äôs head is a red social media notification bubble icon ‚Äî 3D style, shiny red color with a white person silhouette and the number ‚Äú10K‚Äù in bold white letters. Background is a smooth sky-blue radial gradient with soft bokeh circles. Lighting is cheerful, bright key light from front, soft bounce lighting to add realism. Facial fur detail should be rich, shiny highlights on the eyes. Whimsical, high-energy composition with strong center focus, rounded corners, vibrant tones, and aspect ratio 16:9.
